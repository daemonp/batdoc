Description: cat(1) for doc, docx, xls, xlsx, pptx, and pdf -- renders to markdown with bat
 Reads legacy .doc and .xls, modern .docx, .xlsx, and .pptx, and PDF files
 and dumps their text to stdout. When stdout is a terminal the output is
 pretty-printed as syntax-highlighted markdown via bat; when piped,
 plain text is emitted. Format is detected by file signature, not extension.

 Spiritual successor to catdoc. Seven crates, no C, no system libs.
